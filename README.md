a strategy based on the 15-minute sma and atr. 
if for 3 consecutive ticks the close price is above the sma and the atr is above the median atr, a bullish signal is printed. i decided to use the atr to filter out false signals because averaging out the close price isn't exactly guaranteed for solid Ws. i used this strategy with eurusd but looking back, a mean reversion strategy would work better with that market :/
